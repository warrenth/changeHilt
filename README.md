### Summary

This sample is written in Kotlin and based on the
[master](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/master) branch which uses
the following Architecture Components:
 - ViewModel
 - LiveData
 - Data Binding
 - Navigation
 - Room

It uses [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)
for dependency injection.


### Differences with master

 - The ServiceLocator class is removed. Object creation and scoping is handled by Hilt.
 - Flavors `mock` and `prod` are no longer needed for testing so they're removed.


### Testing

UI tests don't rely on using the `mock` flavor to run quickly and hermetically. Instead, they
use Hilt to provide their test versions.

This is done by creating a `CustomTestRunner` that uses an `Application` configured with Hilt. As
per the [Hilt testing documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android),
`@HiltAndroidTest` will automatically create the right Hilt components for each test.
